# Determining Sentiment for Drug Reviews
This is my personal project in which I will build a model to predict the ratings of the drugs based on the reviews, and will analyze what features of different drugs are most often associated with positive and negative sentiment.

DATA was obtained from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29

Dataset Information:

1. drugName (categorical): name of drug 
2. condition (categorical): name of condition 
3. review (text): patient review 
4. rating (numerical): 10 star patient rating 
5. date (date): date of review entry 
6. usefulCount (numerical): number of users who found review useful

## The Jupyter notebook file includes 3 parts;
a-) Exploratory Data Analysis

b-) Reducing Features and Inferential Statistics

c-) Machine Learning
